/* About: */
/* I decided to make GCC Machine Description the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-GCC-Machine-Description) as GCC Machine Description is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the GCC Machine Description language. It only makes sense to have GCC Machine Description the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here. */
